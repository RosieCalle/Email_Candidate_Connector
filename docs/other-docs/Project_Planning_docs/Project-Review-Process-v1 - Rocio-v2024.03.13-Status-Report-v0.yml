Project Review Process - Instructions:

15-minute Review of Your Current Project and Status:

Project Leader: Rocio Calle

Brief Overview: Developing a Python application to connect job seekers with potential employers. The application will use machine learning to match job seekers and fellow Recruiters with open positions.

Project Title:  
    Project and "Product" Description: Email Candidate Connect Application

    Implementation: Python Functions Implementation: 
    Workflow Outline 
    Step 1: (Setting up a GCP (Google Cloud Platform) project account for email service.
    Step 2: Create Credentials for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) API.
    Step 3: Install Require Python Libraries for GCP API.
    Step 4: Write Python Functions.

    #Final Notes:
    *Ensure you have the necessary permissions and scopes for your application to send emails on behalf of users. 
    *Always test your application thoroughly, especially when handling user data and authentication. 
    *Consider adding error handling and logging to your functions for a more robust application.
