So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it's because we don't know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn't for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it\'s because we don\'t know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn\'t for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it\\\'s because we don\\\'t know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn\\\'t for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

THE ICE BUCKET SEEMED APPROPRIATE Greetings! I\'m at the Women In Tech Summit this week buuuuuut also doing a virtual speaking engagement and Speaker Friends from my Philly hotel room. I\'ve got my laptop perched atop an ice bucket and a decorative tray. The desk is near the air conditioning unit which seems to roar to life every time I hit Zoom so I\'ve been stacking pillows on it. New essential equipment for any speaker? The ice bucket at least seems appropriate this week. We\'re celebrating our ninth anniversary! Nine years ago this week, the Innovation Women website went live! Needless to say, LOTS is different. When we started, we were focused on technical and entrepreneurial women. Today we cover 188 different industries and more than 6000 topics!

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it\'s because we don\'t know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn\'t for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it's because we don't know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn't for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it\'s because we don\'t know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn\'t for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it\\\'s because we don\\\'t know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn\\\'t for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

THE ICE BUCKET SEEMED APPROPRIATE Greetings! I\'m at the Women In Tech Summit this week buuuuuut also doing a virtual speaking engagement and Speaker Friends from my Philly hotel room. I\'ve got my laptop perched atop an ice bucket and a decorative tray. The desk is near the air conditioning unit which seems to roar to life every time I hit Zoom so I\'ve been stacking pillows on it. New essential equipment for any speaker? The ice bucket at least seems appropriate this week. We\'re celebrating our ninth anniversary! Nine years ago this week, the Innovation Women website went live! Needless to say, LOTS is different. When we started, we were focused on technical and entrepreneurial women. Today we cover 188 different industries and more than 6000 topics!

So why do so many of us feel reluctant to let our personality shine in business? Maybe it\'s because we don\'t know how. Or worse, we fear showing too much of ourselves will alienate potential clients or colleagues. Surprise! It‚Äôs actually the opposite. People are hungry for personality. That‚Äôs what drives connection. Danielle Hughes, founder of More Than Words Marketing, helps individuals learn how to develop their Genuine Personality Brand to stand out in a sea of sameness and a world of duplicates. Danielle created the concept of Personality Brand after realizing that personal branding isn\'t for everyone. After all, if something is personal, why share it with the world? But our personality is innately baked into who we are and already on display. Danielle helps people tap into that personality, shine a light on it and use it to showcase what makes them special.

Sign up for Innovation Women here! Share This Email Share This Email Share This Email NINE YEARS AND COUNTING Dear Innovation Women Friend, Nine years ago, the first iteration of the Innovation Women platform was live with about 70 speaker profiles. We didn't have speaking opportunities on the platform, or the Green Room, chock full of awesome educational materials but we had speakers and event managers connecting. For the first few years, all the speaking opportunities went out in a weekly OMG-so-freakin'-long email. It was a labor of love and my weekly nemesis. I did all the searches myself and, at first, each opportunity was simply a name and a link. People would forward it around to their friends and I would regularly get emails from random people thanking me for my research, not realizing there was an online platform as well. I had event managers tell me (even then), Innovation Women made their lives so much easier. We grew and added a searchable database of opportunities, weekly community calls, a speaker promotional program and more. In 2020, we added Lioness Magazine, which further expands the community, offering our speakers another outlet for their thought leadership, a place to have their books and podcasts featured and another community for making new connections. And, speaking of connections, read on for just a few of the connections made through our awesome community and the systems designed to support women and other under-represented speakers!

Share This Email Share This Email Share This Email NINE YEARS AND COUNTING Dear Innovation Women Friend, Nine years ago, the first iteration of the Innovation Women platform was live with about 70 speaker profiles. We didn\'t have speaking opportunities on the platform, or the Green Room, chock full of awesome educational materials but we had speakers and event managers connecting. For the first few years, all the speaking opportunities went out in a weekly OMG-so-freakin\'-long email. It was a labor of love and my weekly nemesis. I did all the searches myself and, at first, each opportunity was simply a name and a link. People would forward it around to their friends and I would regularly get emails from random people thanking me for my research, not realizing there was an online platform as well. I had event managers tell me (even then), Innovation Women made their lives so much easier. We grew and added a searchable database of opportunities, weekly community calls, a speaker promotional program and more. In 2020, we added Lioness Magazine, which further expands the community, offering our speakers another outlet for their thought leadership, a place to have their books and podcasts featured and another community for making new connections. And, speaking of connections, read on for just a few of the connections made through our awesome community and the systems designed to support women and other under-represented speakers!

Share This Email Share This Email Share This Email NINE YEARS AND COUNTING Dear Innovation Women Friend, Nine years ago, the first iteration of the Innovation Women platform was live with about 70 speaker profiles. We didn\'t have speaking opportunities on the platform, or the Green Room, chock full of awesome educational materials but we had speakers and event managers connecting. For the first few years, all the speaking opportunities went out in a weekly OMG-so-freakin\'-long email. It was a labor of love and my weekly nemesis. I did all the searches myself and, at first, each opportunity was simply a name and a link. People would forward it around to their friends and I would regularly get emails from random people thanking me for my research, not realizing there was an online platform as well. I had event managers tell me (even then), Innovation Women made their lives so much easier. We grew and added a searchable database of opportunities, weekly community calls, a speaker promotional program and more. In 2020, we added Lioness Magazine, which further expands the community, offering our speakers another outlet for their thought leadership, a place to have their books and podcasts featured and another community for making new connections. And, speaking of connections, read on for just a few of the connections made through our awesome community and the systems designed to support women and other under-represented speakers!

Sign up for Innovation Women here! Share This Email Share This Email Share This Email NINE YEARS AND COUNTING Dear Innovation Women Friend, Nine years ago, the first iteration of the Innovation Women platform was live with about 70 speaker profiles. We didn't have speaking opportunities on the platform, or the Green Room, chock full of awesome educational materials but we had speakers and event managers connecting. For the first few years, all the speaking opportunities went out in a weekly OMG-so-freakin'-long email. It was a labor of love and my weekly nemesis. I did all the searches myself and, at first, each opportunity was simply a name and a link. People would forward it around to their friends and I would regularly get emails from random people thanking me for my research, not realizing there was an online platform as well. I had event managers tell me (even then), Innovation Women made their lives so much easier. We grew and added a searchable database of opportunities, weekly community calls, a speaker promotional program and more. In 2020, we added Lioness Magazine, which further expands the community, offering our speakers another outlet for their thought leadership, a place to have their books and podcasts featured and another community for making new connections. And, speaking of connections, read on for just a few of the connections made through our awesome community and the systems designed to support women and other under-represented speakers!

Sign up for Innovation Women here! Share This Email Share This Email Share This Email NINE YEARS AND COUNTING Dear Innovation Women Friend, Nine years ago, the first iteration of the Innovation Women platform was live with about 70 speaker profiles. We didn\'t have speaking opportunities on the platform, or the Green Room, chock full of awesome educational materials but we had speakers and event managers connecting. For the first few years, all the speaking opportunities went out in a weekly OMG-so-freakin\'-long email. It was a labor of love and my weekly nemesis. I did all the searches myself and, at first, each opportunity was simply a name and a link. People would forward it around to their friends and I would regularly get emails from random people thanking me for my research, not realizing there was an online platform as well. I had event managers tell me (even then), Innovation Women made their lives so much easier. We grew and added a searchable database of opportunities, weekly community calls, a speaker promotional program and more. In 2020, we added Lioness Magazine, which further expands the community, offering our speakers another outlet for their thought leadership, a place to have their books and podcasts featured and another community for making new connections. And, speaking of connections, read on for just a few of the connections made through our awesome community and the systems designed to support women and other under-represented speakers!
