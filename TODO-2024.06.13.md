TODO: MESSAGE PROCESSING

PROBLEM: Right now messages are not being saved to the database because "save-to-database" operations happen AFTER messages processing.  If there are fatal errors during processing, then message never get saved to the database. 

SOLUTION: Change the way messages are processed.  

1) First SAVE ALL MESSAGES, then process them.  

2) Build in fault-tolerance and error-handling, so that when the saved messages are subsequently being processed, error-handling has time to happen.  

3) After all messages are successfully saved, then deleted them.  

TODO: ##############################################################

The email processing errors show many Unicode errors. 

Check gmail to find out what  Unicode characters are permitted in email messaages and binary attachments.  

Base64 or Unicode??  Are all types of attachments always encoded in Base64?
