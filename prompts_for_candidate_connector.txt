Conect candidate using emial recruiter with candidate for the first time using emial

I want to develop a Python application for job recruiters to connect with potential job candidates for the first time using Google email (gmail).  

Please give me a DETAILED "atomic" step-by-step outline of the workflow required to build this Python.  

Then give me the Python functions to implement each (atomic) workflow step in sequence.
